OpenPVRSGX
==========

This branch collects different DDK kernel drivers
into a single branch.
It therefore resembles some excerpt of the original
DDK version management system.
Note that we have not deleted files from earlier
versions in newer ones, so that some directories
pile up a mix of different versions.

File Structure
==============
ddk/				- main directory where we have collected files
  License.txt			- some Intel originated license file
  README.md			- some Intel how to build (from DDK 1.5.15.3226)
  readme.txt			- another Intel collection of copyright notices
  RELNOTES.txt			- Intel release notes
  pvr/				- main tree
    COPYING, INSTALL, GPL-COPYING, MIT-COPYING, ORIGIN.txt, README, TSPA.txt
 				- several copyright and installation notes
    Kbuild			-
    Makefile			-
    eurasiacon/
    include4/
      aw/			- Allwinner specific include extensions
				  IMHO this should not be here but in services4/system/...
      dbgdrvif.h		- debugging related definitions
      img_defs.h		- general helper macros
      img_types.h		- collection of generic type definitions (e.g. IMG_UINT32)
      ioctldef.h		- definitions of ioctls (unclear if related to PVRSGX)
      kernel_types.h		- some macros like UINT32_MAX
      pdumpdefs.h		- some pixel format definitions
      pvr_debug.h		- helper macros for DEBUG build
      pvr_sync_user.h		- some more ioctls() apparently for synchronising something
      pvrmodule.h		- defines MODULE_AUTHOR() and MODULE_LICENSE()
      pvrversion.h		- this defines the DDK version as numbers and strings
				  note: this is presented to user space which checks
				  for a specific version or bails out
      regpaths.h		- appears to be Windows related
      reverse_engineering_debugging.h	- a debug helper function
      services.h		- this is the header to define commands to control the SGX
				  firmware, mmu and other components
      servicesext.h		- a lot of extensions like error numbers, pixel codes...
      sgx_options.h		- macros to build SGX_BUILD_OPTIONS
      sgxapi_km.h		- SGX command codes
				  Most likely this is also compiled into the firmware
				  and partially into user space code and depends
				  on some configuration flags.
				  This is the reason why user-space and kernel driver
				  versions must match exactly (e.g. RELEASE vs. DEBUG)
      sgxscript.h		- somehow related to initialisation and direct register access
    kernel/
      drivers/staging(imgtec/	- something GEM related (unclear)
    services4/
      3rdparty/			- display class and buffer class SoC display glue
      include/			- a lot of command definitions
        env/linux*/pvr_drm_shared.h	- ?
      srvkm/			- SGX driver core library (should be mostly OS agnostic)
        bridged/			- ?
        common/			- a library for common objects (e.g. devicemem, handles, hash, lists, queues, refcount ... and common tasks
        devices/sgx/		- low level communication with SGX hardware (and firmware?)
        env/linux		- functions to glue to Linux environment (depdends on kernel API)
        hwdefs/			- constants which depend on the SGX version (e.g. 530 vs. 544)
        includes/		- header files for this library
      system/			- specific SoC integration dependent code (e.g. power mgmt, clock, timers)
    tools/
      intern/debug/		- source for user-space debug driver tool
      intern/remview/		- some stale makefiles
